TODO:

maybe create tmp.xml file and parse via "xml" lib
or stream gzip uncompressed file into "xml" lib (probably faster)

once xml parsed and deserialized into FileRef type
deduplicate based on file name

allow for options to only collect certain File types (AbletonPreset, AbletonPlugin, RecordedFile, etc)
ensure file is not already collected before copying

BONUS: avoid name collisions (maybe copy file structure into the collected folder)
BONUS: modify existing XML to use resolved file path locations

-- SO UNNECESSARY
EXTRA BONUS: resolve duplicates or crop files to only used length to reduce disk space
