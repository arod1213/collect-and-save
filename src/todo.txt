Better error messages
!!! Implement streaming or tmp file for gzip to xml

CLI Config setup
    > Config struct {
        ask_mode: per_session, per_audio, none
        cmd: Mode,
        copy_mode: all, recorded, plugins, imported
      }
    add interactive mode
    first run check -> then if accepted collect
  
! nodesByName should have a ref to the map to deduplicate before ending up in the main func
  will cut allocations in half if not more

! Update shouldCollect() method
    probably some edges case to check out
    write tests to simulate

! Fix FileType enum (file type doesnt mean what i think it does)
! Choose output directory based on file type and FileType enum (possibly?)
    maybe still use unique directory to avoid overwrites
! check session directory to see if file has already been collected
    (do the above after dedup and before resolving the file aka copy)

ask for user input before each file is scanned for unique types of scan
  also allow global scan type for all files

allow for options to only collect certain File types (AbletonPreset, AbletonPlugin, RecordedFile, etc)
  ensure file is not already collected before copying
  ^^ implemented (but maybe check file size before asserting true)

create c ABI funcs to wrap the api

maybe integrate AMS lib to get the most recent session out of each folder
  (above will have to be upgrade to search for only ableton files)
  (also output will have to be written to stdout instead of text search lib)

BONUS: avoid name collisions (maybe copy file structure into the collected folder)
BONUS: modify existing XML to use resolved file path locations

EXTRA BONUS: resolve duplicates or crop files to only used length to reduce disk space
  so unnecessary
