TODO:

check session directory to see if file has already been collected
(do the above after dedup and before resolving the file aka copy)

ask for user input before each file is scanned for unique types of scan
also allow global scan type for all files

allow for options to only collect certain File types (AbletonPreset, AbletonPlugin, RecordedFile, etc)
ensure file is not already collected before copying

create c ABI funcs to wrap the api

maybe integrate AMS lib to get the most recent session out of each folder
(above will have to be upgrade to search for only ableton files)
(also output will have to be written to stdout instead of text search lib)

BONUS: avoid name collisions (maybe copy file structure into the collected folder)
BONUS: modify existing XML to use resolved file path locations

-- SO UNNECESSARY
EXTRA BONUS: resolve duplicates or crop files to only used length to reduce disk space
